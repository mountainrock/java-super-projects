 * What is your format: text or binary? If binary - use inputStream or outPutStream (reads data as 8 bit -bytes at a time). if text - use Reader or Writer ( reads data as 16 bit UNICODE characters) Do
 * you want random access capability? The RandomAccessFile class permits random access. The data is Using random access files improves performance and efficiency. Are you dealing with objects or
 * non-objects? Use ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream What are your sources and sinks for data? What is the source of your data? What will be consuming your output data, that is, acting as a
 * sink? You can input or output your data in a number of ways: sockets, files, strings, and arrays of characters. Do you need to use filtering? Buffering is one filtering method. Instead of going
 * back to the operating system for each byte, you can use an object to provide a buffer. Checksumming is another filtering method. As you are reading or writing a stream, you might want to compute a
 * checksum on it. DAtaInputStream and DAtaOutputStream ? You can take a primitive, like an int, and write it out. It is written in a platform-independent form. You can read that int back in on any
 * other Java virtual machine and, regardless of where it was produced, it will be turned back into an int of the proper value.
