/**
 * This is a semantic interface that indicates that a command object is a redo command.
 * <p>
 * Most subclasses of the AbstractCommand classes are responsible for encapsulating the top level logic of whatever commend they represent. Redo is a special case that is treated differently. Because
 * redo is the responsibility of the CommandManager, all that a class that represents redo should do is let a CommandManager object know that it should redo the the most recently undone command. It is
 * preferable for it to do that in a way that does not expose any special logic of the CommandManager class. The CommandManager class has no other reason to know about and subclasses of
 * AbstractCommand, so the mechanism for it finding out that it is supposed to redo a command should not make it dependant on any subclasses of AbstractCommand.
 * <p>
 * An organization that satisifes those constraints is for the subclass of AbstractCommand that represents unto to implement this interface and not actually do anything. When a CommandManager object
 * notices that it is being given an object ot execute that implements the Redo interface, instead of trying to invoke the command normally, it will redo the previous redo.
